üåê Responsive Web Interface from Figma
This project demonstrates the ability to translate high-fidelity UI/UX designs from a tool like Figma directly into a robust, device-agnostic web application using modern front-end technologies.

The goal was to achieve pixel-perfect execution of the design while ensuring full responsiveness and optimal performance across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports.

üõ† Technology Stack
HTML5: Semantic structure for content.

Tailwind CSS: Utility-first framework for rapid, responsive styling.

JavaScript: Minor scripting for UI interactions (e.g., mobile navigation toggle).

Design Tool: Inspired by mock-ups created in Figma.

‚ú® Key Design & Technical Achievements
Mobile-First Approach: The layout was built starting from the smallest screen size, utilizing Tailwind's responsive prefixes (sm:, lg:) to progressively enhance the layout for larger screens.

Fluid Typography: Text sizes and spacing adapt using relative units and responsive breakpoints to maintain readability.

Clean Code: All styling is contained within a single file using Tailwind, demonstrating efficiency and maintainability.

Aesthetic Polish: Implementation includes modern design elements like rounded corners, shadows, and subtle transitions, reflecting current design trends.
